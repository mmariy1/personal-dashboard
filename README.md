# personal-dashboard
This is a personal dashboard. I used the Unsplash and Open Weather APIs to get the background image and the temperature. I also added a To-Do list, where the user can create tasks and delete them when they're completed. This was made as a chrome extension, so the user will see the page every time they open a new tab. This project is part of the Frontend Career Path on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). Check out the netlify version [here](https://66a945e210de998b5f664a9e--classy-alfajores-03f56c.netlify.app/) :)
